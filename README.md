# Frontend Error Monitor 

A production-style **frontend error monitoring system** built with React.  
This project captures runtime errors, promise rejections, and network failures, then displays them in an admin-style dashboard for analysis.

> Designed to demonstrate real-world frontend reliability, observability, and defensive engineering.

- Global JavaScript error capture
- Unhandled Promise rejection tracking
- Network error interception
- Error normalization & persistence
- Admin dashboard with analytics
- Error filtering & search
- Export logs as JSON
- Demo error simulator
- Clean, scalable architecture

In real production apps, **errors are inevitable**.  
What matters is **how you handle, log, and learn from them**.

This project focuses on:
- Stability over features
- User-friendly crash handling
- Developer observability
- Production-ready architecture
